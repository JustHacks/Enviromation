# Inspiration
Environment is no one’s property to destroy; it’s everyone’s responsibility to protect. We continue to destroy our environment every day whether we realize it or not, from the simple use of plastic bags, to emmision of green house gases. Global warming is a huge issue that continues to happen today, as the amount of greenhouse gases that are emitted by us increases. According to ourworldindata.org over 50.000.000.000 tonnes of Carbon dioxide are emitted each year, which is a crazy amount. So, we strive to create a website that spreads information about saving the environment in a fun and interactive way.

# What it does

With all these features of our website, It is the complete platform for creating awareness in people and helping them in realise the impact of and suggest them some solutions which they can use to make the world a better place.

### Food Ration Manager -
The prototype we built for the Food Ration Manager helps us reduce our food wastage.Food wastage is a big problem which leads to a loss of energy and kills many animals.With this feature we solve that problem we suggest each family member the appropriate units of each food item they need to buy to keep themselves healthy based on their weight, height and sex.This also helps them be healthy and active!

### Hazard Help Requests -
This feature on our website helps the people create a request on our page if they see any medium-large scale activities in their neighbourhood, they could report it to us where we would review it and send them to variuos environment saving organizations near the area of the request.
